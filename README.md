# HOS – Hacker Operating System  
⚡ *A modular, C-based Linux framework for hackers and tinkerers.*

**Version**: Alpha 1.2
**Author**: Brian Riff  
**Release Date**: May 21, 2025  

---

HOS is a lightweight operating system framework built in C, designed for hackers, developers, and system-level explorers. It includes real-time networking tools, a custom shell, and modular architecture — all open and extensible.

🟥 Warning: This OS does need superuser privileges to run, and uses them for creating files and directories, along with accessing core networking utilities.

Whether you're learning OS internals or building your own low-level tools, HOS provides a clean, powerful foundation.
